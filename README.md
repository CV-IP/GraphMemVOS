## Testing
1. Install python (3.6.5), pytorch (version:1.0.1) and requirements in the txt files.
2. Download the pretrained model from [googledrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HO6wlhAYSuBDx4Cnb8efQyLs357ycDz2/view?usp=sharing) and put it into the workspace_STM_alpha files. 
3. Run 'run_graph_memory_test.sh' and change the davis dataset path, pretrainde model path and result path.

The segmentation results can be download from [googledrive]()
